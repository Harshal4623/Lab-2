  <h2>Much Ado About Nothing</h2>
  <p><strong>Scene I.</strong> A hall in Leonato's house.</p>

  <p><em>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others.</em></p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Was not Count John here at supper?</dd>

    <dt><strong>ANTONIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>I saw him not.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after.</dd>

    <dt><strong>HERO</strong></dt>
    <dd>He is of a very melancholy disposition.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick:
      the one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face,--</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world,
      if a' could get her good-will.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</dd>

    <dt><strong>ANTONIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>In faith, she's too curst.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's sending that way; for it is said, "God sends a curst cow short horns;"
      but to a cow too curst he sends none.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening.
      Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman?
      He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man:
      and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him:
      therefore, I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Well, then, go you into hell?</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say
      "Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here's no place for you maids:" so deliver I up my apes,
      and away to Saint Peter for the heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>ANTONIO</strong></dt>
    <dd><em>[To HERO]</em> Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say "Father, as it please you."
      But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and say "Father, as it please me."
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust?
      to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
      and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time: if the prince be too important,
      tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding,
      and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque pace...
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BEATRICE</strong></dt>
    <dd>I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.</dd>

    <dt><strong>LEONATO</strong></dt>
    <dd>The revellers are entering, brother: make good room. All put on their masks.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><em>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked.</em></p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Lady, will you walk about with your friend?</dd>

    <dt><strong>HERO</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></dt>
    <dd>With me in your company?</dd>

    <dt><strong>HERO</strong></dt>
    <dd>I may say so, when I please.</dd>

    <dt><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Speak low, if you speak love.</dd>

    <dt><strong>HERO</strong></dt>
    <dd><em>[Drawing her aside]</em></dd>
  </dl>

  <p><em>Music. Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO.</em></p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>DON JOHN</strong></dt>
    <dd>Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BORACHIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.</dd>

    <dt><strong>DON JOHN</strong></dt>
    <dd>Are not you Signior Benedick?</dd>

    <dt><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>You know me well; I am he.</dd>

    <dt><strong>DON JOHN</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her:
      she is no equal for his birth...
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>How know you he loves her?</dd>

    <dt><strong>DON JOHN</strong></dt>
    <dd>I heard him swear his affection.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BORACHIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.</dd>

    <dt><strong>DON JOHN</strong></dt>
    <dd>Come, let us to the banquet.</dd>

    <dt><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio...
      Farewell, therefore, Hero!
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p><em>Re-enter BENEDICK.</em></p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>BENEDICK</strong></dt>
    <dd>Count Claudio?</dd>

    <dt><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>Yea, the same.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BENEDICK</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Come, will you go with me? ... You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>I wish him joy of her.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BENEDICK</strong></dt>
    <dd>Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier...</dd>

    <dt><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></dt>
    <dd>I pray you, leave me.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BENEDICK</strong></dt>
    <dd>Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges...</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><em>Exeunt.</em></p>
